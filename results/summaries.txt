Hierarchical Network Fusion for Multi-Modal Electron Micrograph Representation Learning with Foundational Large Language Models Anonymous Author(s) Affiliation Address email Abstract Characterizing materials with electron micrographs is a crucial task in fields such as semiconductors and quantum materials . in 3 this study, we propose an innovative backbone architecture for analyzing electron 4 micrographs . we create multi-modal representations by tok- 5 enizing them into patch sequences and, additionally, representing them as vision 6 graphs, commonly referred to as patch attributed graphs. hier- 7 archical network structure architecture 8 facilitates information exchange between the multi-modal representations and 9 knowledge integration across different patch resolutions . cross-domain repre- 13 sentations predict the nanomaterial 14 category . multi-faceted approach promises a more comprehensive and accu- 15 rate representation . the precise design, development, 21 and testing of semiconductor devices is essential for ensuring the reliability, durability, and perfor- 22 mance of high-tech chips . advanced imaging and analysis techniques are key to fabricating 23 and integrating nanoscale components and enabling advanced inspection . sizes now reach 25 as small as 7 nm or even smaller . the increased complexity of producing chips under 7 26 nanometers introduces greater potential for error . the semiconductor industry uses 28 electron beam tools to create 29 high-resolution images of these devices . electron micrographs reveal the 30 complex microstructures of materials . they are crucial for the accurate design and evaluation of 31 semiconductor devices . these images facilitate monitoring of 33 the process and defect detection . the autolabeling of electron micrographs for nanomaterial identification remains a significant challenge . Figure 1 shows the challenges in nanomaterial iden- 36 tification tasks . this is largely attributed to distributional shifts such as manufacturing variations 37 or material property changes . exacerbated by high intra-class dissimilarity within nanomaterials, 38 high inter-class similarity . we propose a 40 end-to-end framework for automatic nanomaterial identification . we hypothesize that electron micrographs exhibit 43 hierarchical dependencies . these 44 dependencies can be captured using multiple patch sequences and vision graph structures . to explore this, we tokenize the electron micrographs into grid-like 46 patches to obtain a patch sequence . a cls>token is introduced to the patch sequence and a virtual node to the 50 vision graph . this special token/virtual node captures 51 global graph information in their respective contexts . we aim to capture fine- and coarse-grained 52 hierarchical dependencies by treating micrographs as sequence structures and vision graphs at 53 multiple scales of patch size . the hierarchical network fusion (HNF) is a cascading network architec- 55 ture that enhances classification accuracy by analyzing and integrating two complemen- 56 tary representations of electron micrographs . vision graphs are 57 created at various patch sizes . the HNF is a 61 multi-layered network featuring an inverted pyramid architecture that generates a multi-scale 62 representation of an electron micrograph by creating a series of patch sequences and vision 63 graphs . each layer represents the original 65 micrograph-based patch sequence and vision graph at a distinct scale . by considering information at multiple scales, the HNF facilitates a 67 more comprehensive representation of the electron micrograph . the patch embeddings are iteratively refined using 69 bidirectional Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) [ 20], while the Graph 70 Chebyshev Convolution (GCC) Networks [ 51,28] encode the vision graphs in a layer-wise 71 manner . a mixture-of-experts technique with a 72 gating mechanism optimally combines predictions from both modalities at each layer by 73 calculating a weighted sum of classification token and virtual node embedding . this facilitates an intermodal mutual information exchange, fos- 75 tering interaction and knowledge integration between the two modal this innovative 76 approach enables the seamless integration of causal information from patch sequences to 77 refine the vision graph embeddings . our framework constructs a multi-scale representation of a 80 micrograph . aim is to preserve both high-level features and structural 81 information embedded in the graphs . large 84 language models (LLMs) generate technical descriptions of nanomaterials, 85 including synthesis methods, properties, and applications . we pre-train smaller language 86 models (LMs) [ 30,52] through self-supervised masked language modeling [ 5,30] on 87 these generated textual descriptions . we 90 use a weighted sum-pooling attention mechanism to compute text-level embeddings 91 . we encapsulate the vast domain-specific knowledge present in the 92 text data . our approach leverages LLM-based technical descriptions on nanomaterials to 93 identify characteristic features that distinguish them from other nanomaterial categories . 94 incorporate domain-specific knowledge as auxiliary information for downstream training . electron micrograph classification task is a type of inductive learning 97 task . the task is to assign labels to new, unseen micrographs using a labeled dataset 98 2 denoted as DL= (IL,YL) ypred i=f(Ii)denote the multi-modal encoder predictions . l(,) denotes the cross-entropy 103 loss . electron micrographs across different nanomaterial categories exhibit a noteworthy degree of similarity . the figure provides a visual representation of the challenges of classifying electron nanographs in the SEM dataset([4]). our framework includes three methods: Zero-Shot Prompting Textual Explanations LLM LM Attention Pooling Text-level Embedding . a) b) Nearest Neighbour Graph Electron Micrograph Hierarchical Network Fusion (HNF) Output Layer (MHA layer) we 108 divide the micrograph into a grid of patches, each having dimensions of ppc . 109 the patch size is given by n=hw/p2 . 111 These patches are linearly transformed to create a new tensor, I′Rnd . to account for the position of each patch within the micrograph, we introduce 113 position embeddings . k-nearest 116 neighbors graph analyzes pairwise relationships between micrograph patches . the graph structure is described by a binary adjacency matrix, ARnn . we tokenize electron micrographs by dividing them into grid-like patches . patches are connected by edges that represent pairwise visual similarity 124 using a nearest-neighbor graph technique . the vision graph captures local patch relationships and 125 uses graph-structural priors to analyze pairwise spatial dependencies within the micrograph . 126 Additionally, we represent electron micrographs as a patch sequence, capturing pairwise space 127 dependencies beyond the original sparse graph structure . we append a classification token to a patch sequence 130 to obtain an embedding of the entire patch sequence that captures global information . virtual edges represent the pairwise relations between each 133 real node and the virtual node . the virtual node embedding captures dependencies 134 between nodes . we hypothesize that 135 electron micrographs exhibit hierarchical dependencies among patches . hierarchical network fusion (HNF) is a cascading network architecture that constructs a 138 multi-scale representation of an electron micrograph by creating a series of patch sequences and 139 vision graphs at multiple scales . h1(l)h2(l+1)hn(l+1)hCLS (l+ 1) Layer (l + 1) VNVN Figure 3: Overview of the HNF module . the HNF module utilizes a multi-layered network with increasing patch sizes to represent the electron micrograph-based patch sequence and vision graph at various scales . each layer involves bidirectional Neural ODEs and Graph Chebyshev convolution . a gating mechanism integrates cross-domain embeddings . the HNF module facilitates seamless information fusion . hl iandel i denotes the patch representation at layer lof patch or node i . the HNF architecture synergistically combines patch sequences and vision graphs representations at 141 different scales . each layer of the network represents the original micrograph-based patch sequence and 144 vision graph . the network offers a more comprehensive representation of the micrograph . each layer uses a bidirectional Neural ODE (refer to the appendix) to iteratively refine patch 148 embeddings . Graph Chebyshev Convolution 150 Network maps high-dimensional discrete vision graph information to 151 low-dimensional node-level embeddings . 152 structural information embedded in graphs is optimally preserved . mixture-of-experts 153 uses a gating mechanism to combine predictions from the bidirectional Neural 154 ODEs and the Graph Chebyshev Convolution methods . training objectives include 156 optimizing the weight distribution of the gating function for accurate classification of nanomaterial 157 categories in electron micrographs . the framework aims to improve classification accuracy by leveraging the 159 strengths of multiple learning methods . the gating mechanism is combined with the individual modalities at higher 162 patch resolution . our framework incorporates bidirectional Neural ODEs and Graph Chebyshev 163 networks to facilitate the exchange of mutual information between patch sequences and visual graphs 164 . this approach allows the patch 165 embeddings to be grounded with structural and semantic information . 168 3.3 Beyond Conventional Analysis: Leveraging LLMs for Nanomaterial Characterization 169 The advent of large pre-trained language models (LLMs) has significantly revolutionized performance in various natural 171 language processing tasks . small-scale language models lack the 173 strong logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs . 172 are computationally affordable for fine-tuning using labeled data for specialized task adaptation . general-purpose LLMs require significant computational resources for repurposing through 179 fine-tuning for task-specific customization . they do not provide access to token 180 embeddings and logits, aiding in explainability . the language modeling as a service platform provides access to LLMs 182 via text-based API interaction through cloud-based services . but the integration of 183 vision graphs remains an underexplored area, opening up the possibility for innovative techniques 184 that combine language models . our approach capitalizes on zero-shot chain-of-thought 186 (Zero-Shot CoT) . we pre- 187 train smaller LMs on the generated textual descriptions using the masked language modeling technique 188 . our work evaluates two LLMs: GPT-3.5-turbo, and Google 194 BARD1 . we then fine-tune smaller LMs for 190 downstream supervised multi-class classification task . newer and larger extension of GPT-3.5 model from OpenAI excels in 195 languages and shows cost-effectiveness .
